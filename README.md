# Pwned-Password-Dataset
Pwned Passwords are 613,584,246 real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. They're searchable online below as well as being downloadable for use in other online systems : https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords. Datasets can be available here. Our master dataset is manipulated through filters based on NIST and other datasets.
