# Pwned-Password-Dataset
Pwned Passwords are 613,584,246 real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. They're searchable online below as well as being downloadable for use in other online systems : https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords. Datasets can be available here. Our master dataset is manipulated through filters based on NIST and other datasets, and is mainly based on this kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/avantikapoddar/bad-password-nist

This dataset can used to build password classifiers, to determine if a password is good or bad, according to a combination of standards, or the breached passwords can be examined for new patterns and trends to determine breachability.
